# 🔌 Capacitive-Touch-Keypad
Ever played osu! and saw people using a 2-key keyboard then looked online and saw that the 2 keys were worth more than a full-sized keyboard so you decided to try to find how to make one yourself but there was nothing good online so you decide to take matters into your own hands and make one from scratch? Me neither.

## ⭐ About
This is a capacitive touch keypad that mimics the technology used in the pro x touch. It's essentially a capacitive sensor that senses disruptions in electical fields and converts these disruptions into key-strokes. The idea is reducing travel distance and removing the latency between when you first touch the key and when it first senses a key-stroke.
